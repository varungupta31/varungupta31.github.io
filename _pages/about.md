I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I work on visual understanding and representation learning — essentially, teaching computers how to watch and make sense of the world!

I’m fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/) and [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/), while collaborating closely with [Dr. Vineet Gandhi](https://www.iiit.ac.in/faculty/vineet-gandhi/).

<b>Previously</b>, I was a Research Fellow with the Mobility Group at CVIT, collaborating with [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anbumanisubramanian/?originalSubdomain=inn) (Intel) on an autonomous driving project, tackling road infrastructure challenges in unconstrained environments. During my <b>undergrad</b>, I interned at [NIT Goa](https://www.nitgoa.ac.in/), where I worked with [Dr. Lalat Indu Giri](https://www.nitgoa.ac.in/People/frontend/lalat.html) on contactless respiratory rate monitoring using infrared thermography.

Beyond research, you’ll find me cooking, biking around, vibing to music, capturing moments, or lifting some heavy weights!
